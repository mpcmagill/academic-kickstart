In this post, I'm going to give a brief overview on using neural networks to learn the solutions of differential equations directly.
I'll also try to provide a roadmap of the literature on this subject, which is a little fragmented.


### Examples of Differential Equation Problems

Let's start with an example.
One of the simplest boundary value problems of interest is given by the two-dimensional Laplace equation,
$u$
