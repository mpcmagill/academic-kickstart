Since 2017, I have been working at the [UOIT Science Caf&eacute;](https://www.facebook.com/UOITScienceCafe/). This is a weekly drop-in session open to all UOIT science students. I provide help with mathematics, physics, and computer science courses.

I also work as a teaching assistant. This entails reviewing lecture material in tutorials, providing focused help in office hours, and assisting with the administration and marking of assessments.
I have been a teaching assistant for the following courses at UOIT:

* Advanced Linear Algebra and Applications (MATH 2055)
* Discrete Mathematics (MATH 2080/CSCI 2110)
* Classical Mechanics (PHY 2030)
* Linear Algebra for Engineers (MATH 1850)
* Calculus 1 & 2 (MATH 1010 & 1020)
* Physics 1 (PHY 1010)

I've also had the opportunity to present lectures on the following topics:

* Quadratic forms for Advanced Linear Algebra and Applications (MATH 2055)
* Bessel functions for Mathematical Physics (PHY 3040)
