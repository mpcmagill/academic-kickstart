# Biography

Martin Magill is a PhD student in modelling and computational science under the supervision of [Dr. Hendrick de Haan](https://faculty.uoit.ca/dehaan/cNAB.LAB/member.php?varname=mem_hdh) in the [cNAB.LAB](https://faculty.uoit.ca/dehaan/cNAB.LAB/about.shtml) for computational nanobiophysics.
Recently, Martin has been exploring the use of deep neural networks for solving the partial differential equations that describe electric fields and molecular transport through nanofluidic devices.
The appeal of this study is twofold.
Neural networks have diverse advantages over traditional PDE solution methods.
For instance, they are analytic, meshfree, and highly parallelizable, making them especially appealing for solving higher-dimensional problems, as well as for GPU-accelerated computation.
Conversely, this research also provides an opportunity for studying the complex dynamics of deep learning in a controlled setting.
In contrast with traditional applications of deep learning, such as machine vision and natural language processing, there exists an enormous body of knowledge regarding the solution of PDEs.
In a [recent study](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00042) on the internal structure of deep neural networks trained to solve a parametrized family of boundary value problems, Martin demonstrated that these networks can learn general representations that are robust even across variations in the problem parameters.

Previously, Martin has conducted research across a broad range of areas in computational science and data analysis.
As part of an international collaboration with the [T.-Cossa LAB](http://tcossalab.net/) and the [Nanomembrane Research Group](http://nanomembranes.org/), Martin contributed to a study exploring nanoscale preconfinement of DNA molecules as a means of stabilizing their translocation through a nanopore.
He used simulations to study the dynamics of molecules in the device, and also assisted with the analysis of experimental data.
That work was [published](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b03987) as the cover article of Nano Letters.
In his master's thesis, Martin studied the translocation of polymers through a nanofluidic device consisting of two nanopores connected by a nanocavity.
This work was [published](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.247802) in Physical Review Letters and led to a patent.
During his undergraduate degree, Martin conducted research in nuclear reactor physics at Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (formerly Atomic Energy of Canada Limited), dark matter physics at SNOLAB, machine learning for cosmic ray tomography with the CRIPT project, and computational fluid dynamics under the supervision of [Prof. Marek Stastna](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~mmstastn/Marek%27s%20home/Welcome.html).
