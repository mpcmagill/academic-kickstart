# Biography

Martin Magill is a PhD student in modelling and computational science at UOIT's [cNAB.LAB](https://faculty.uoit.ca/dehaan/cNAB.LAB/about.shtml) for computational nanobiophysics. His research interests include modelling and simulating first passage problems in computational nanobiophysics. Recently, he has been exploring the use of deep neural networks for solving the partial differential equations that describe electric fields and particle transport through nanofluidic devices.

The appeal of this study is twofold. First, neural networks have diverse advantages over traditional PDE solvers, especially in high-dimensional problems. Second, provides a controlled environment in which to study neural networks themselves.
