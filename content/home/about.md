# Biography

Martin Magill is a PhD student in modelling and computational science under the supervision of [Prof. Hendrick de Haan](https://faculty.uoit.ca/dehaan/cNAB.LAB/member.php?varname=mem_hdh) in the [cNAB.LAB](https://faculty.uoit.ca/dehaan/cNAB.LAB/about.shtml) for computational nanobiophysics. Martin's research interests include modelling and simulating the behaviour of molecules at the nanoscale. Recently, he has been exploring the use of deep neural networks for solving the partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe electric fields and molecular transport through nanofluidic devices.

Previously, Martin has conducted research across a broad range of areas in computational science. In his master's thesis, he studied the translocation of polymers through a nanofluidic device consisting of two nanopores connected by a nanocavity. This work was [published](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.247802) in PRL and led to a patent. During his undergraduate degree, Martin conducted research in nuclear reactor physics at Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (formerly Atomic Energy of Canada Limited), dark matter physics at SNOLAB, machine learning for cosmic ray tomography with the CRIPT project, and computational fluid dynamics under the supervision of [Prof. Marek Stastna](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~mmstastn/Marek%27s%20home/Welcome.html).
